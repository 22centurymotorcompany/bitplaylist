# Bitplaylist

A community powered repository of Bitquery examples. You are very welcome to send a pull request if you have a useful query.

This repository is made up of two categories:

1. Bitdb
2. Bitsocket

Both [bitdb](https://bitdb.fountainhead.cash/explorer) and [bitsocket](https://bitsocket.fountainhead.cash) use [Bitquery](https://docs.fountainhead.cash/docs/query_v3) as the query language, so you can use exactly the same query to fetch (BitDB) AND monitor (Bitsocket) the blockchain.

However Bitsocket supports a subset of Bitquery. Specifically:

You can use [bitsocket-debug-server](https://github.com/fountainhead-cash/bitsocket-debug-server) to easily test your queries against transactions you create, without having to spend any BCH.
